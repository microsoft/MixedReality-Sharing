MixedReality-Sharing is a cross-platform solution to enable rich multiuser experiences. In particular most mixed reality experiences need the following:
 - Matchmaking - find and join experiences
 - Streaming - transmit and receive audio/video/data
 - Localization - agree a shared reference frame (anchor)

MixedReality-Sharing provides library packages to fulfil each of the above needs. The packages are independent, meaning they can be adopted or replaced incrementally. Integration libraries are provided so that the packages work together seamlessly, both with each other and with external libraries.

## Matchmaking

The [Matchmaking.Discovery](libs/Matchmaking/docs/index.md)  is based on a simple advertisement/discovery protocol. The transport is pluggable and there are implementations for peer-to-peer UDP broadcast and dedicated server.

## Streaming

We recommend [MixedReality-WebRTC](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-WebRTC) for streaming audio, video and data. As with any WebRTC solution, an external signaling mechanism is required to establish a connection. We provide an in-process signaling solution to make this easy.

## Localization

On augmented reality (AR) platforms, “anchors” are a common frame of reference for enabling multiple users to place digital content in the same physical location, where it can be seen on different devices in the same position and orientation relative to the environment.

[SpatialAlignment](libs/SpatialAlignment/docs/index.md) allows a variety of backends such as [Azure Spatial Anchors](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/spatial-anchors/) or [Fiduciary Markers]() such as QR codes.
