    "keywords": "The Matchmaking library automates the process of discovering and joining MR experiences over the network. Matchmaking is a C# .NET Standard 2.0 library. It is available as a NuGet package . Alternatively, the Microsoft.MixedReality.Sharing.Matchmaking project can be added to a Visual Studio solution and built from source. Currently the library contains a simple system to publish and discover arbitrary resources (application users, shared experiences, or others) on a local network using UDP. Check the project roadmap for planned features. Resource discovery Matchmaking defines a resource as an application-specific entity available on the network. Application clients looking for shared experiences can be resources, as well as hosting servers or individual sessions of a shared experience. A resource has: a connection string : an application-defined string that indicates how to connect to the resource. This can be an URL, an IP address-port pair, or any string that can be interpreted by the network transport used by the application to start a communication with the resource. a category string : an application-defined string that indicates the type of the resource. This can be used to distinguish between resources published by different applications or between different types of resources within the same application (e.g. users vs shared sessions). a set of optional attributes , application-defined key-value pairs. These can be used to expose room properties or capabilities to the discovery system. IDiscoveryAgent is the main entry point of the discovery system. Through an agent you can: publish resources on the network for other application processes to discover: IDiscoveryAgent agent = InitDiscoveryAgent(); var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(); string category = \"myapp/session\"; string connection = \"http://myappserver.org/session42\"; var attributes = new Dictionary<string, string>{ [\"environment\"] = \"house\" }; IDiscoveryResource newSession = await agent.PublishAsync(category, connection, attributes, cts.Token); subscribe to resources published by other application processes: string category = \"myapp/session\"; IDiscoverySubscription sessionSubscription = agent.Subscribe(category); IDiscoveryResource foundSession = null; sessionSubscription.Updated += subscription => { foreach (IDiscoveryResource res in sessionSubscription.Resources) { if (res.Attributes[\"environment\"] == \"house\") { Console.WriteLine(\"Discovered session at \" + res.Connection); foundSession = res; // Unsubscribe from further updates. sessionSubscription.Dispose(); } } }; The IDiscoveryResource interface gives read access to resources published and discovered. In general, the publisher of a resource can edit its attribute after publishing by calling IDiscoveryResource.RequestEdit and using the obtained IDiscoveryResourceEditor . IDiscoveryAgent.Dispose() stops advertising resources and terminates any active subscriptions. See the P2PChat demo for a usage example. Peer-to-peer discovery agent The discovery API is generic and can be implemented on top of a variety of protocols/network transports. The Matchmaking library contains a simple implementation, useful for prototypes/demos where all the participant devices are joined to the same local network or multicast group. PeerDiscoveryAgent implements IDiscoveryAgent using a simple peer-to-peer protocol loosely based on SSDP . When an agent publishes a resource, it starts periodically broadcasting announcement messages announcing its availability and attributes. When an agent subscribes to a category, it broadcasts a query message to which publishers reply with the current active resources, and starts listening for periodic announcements. Every announcement contains the resource lifetime in seconds - agents will consider a resource expired after an interval equal to its lifetime has passed from the last announcement about the resource. Messages are exchanged between agents using a IPeerDiscoveryTransport specified on agent creation: var transport = new UdpPeerDiscoveryTransport(IPAddress.Broadcast, 45278); var agent = new PeerDiscoveryAgent(transport); IPeerDiscoveryTransport is a simple convenience interface to send and receive broadcast messages among peers. The library contains an implementation that exchanges messages through UDP broadcast/multicast ( UdpPeerDiscoveryTransport ) plus a memory-based, in-process one for testing ( MemoryPeerDiscoveryTransport ). Limitations PeerDiscoveryAgent is meant to be used in small-size prototypes and is not recommended in production application that expect to handle many concurrent agents/resources. Importantly, the implementation assumes a trusted network and it is not suitable to applications that might deal with malicious network traffic. UdpPeerDiscoveryTransport sends one UDP packet per resource announcement, including all the resource data - category, connection, attributes. Depending on the network configuration, UDP packets bigger than a certain size might be fragmented - increasing packet loss and decreasing performance - or dropped by the network stack. The implementation will therefore work reliably only if the total data for each resource is low - generally under 1KB."

    "title": "Roadmap | MixedReality-Sharing Documentation",
    "keywords": "Project Goal The goal of MixedReality-Sharing is to provide a set cross-platform networking libraries which provide a solid foundation for rich multi-user experiences. Concretely, this covers everything from discovering peers, establishing connections and exchanging messages with them. We do this via the following independent packages Discovery - Decide who is included in the experience Audio/Video/Data streams - Exchange media and data Spatial Alignment - Establish a shared frame of reference Synchronization - High level state synchronization Milestones Milestones are only roughly in expected chronological order. Audio/Video/Data (Shipped October 2019) Goal: Ship a networking solution which supports audio/video/data. Our solution is based on WebRTC. MixedReality-WebRTC 1.0.0 comes support for C#/C++, Desktop/UWP, ARM/x86/x64. https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-WebRTC/releases/tag/v1.0.0 This adds support for WebRTC on windows platforms. Developers can be sure that our devices have good support. E.g. Hardware video encode/decode, integration with unusual devices such as mixed reality capture (mixed camera and rendered content) as as video source. Developers still need to supply their own signalling solution (before opening a WebRTC connection, some out-of-band messages must be exchanged configure media types and perform NAT punchthrough) Network Autoconfiguration Goal: Provide a mechanism for automatic configuration. Remove the need for explicit IP addresses. This milestone adds v0.0.1 of Matchmaking discovery mechanism which allows simple network autoconfiguration. This initial implementation works via UDP broadcast. In other words, all devices must be on the same subnet. Future versions will lift this restriction. This release will be used as an integration test in a branch of SpectatorView . As well as the portable C# implementation, there will be some Unity specific UI components for things such as choosing a session if there are several available. Spatial Alignment Goal: Simplify establishing a shared reference frame. To create holograms which can be viewed from multiple devices, they must know their positions relative to one or more fixed points (spatial anchors). With this milestone, applications can easily create content which is firmly anchored to the real world. Several swappable backends are available. QR code can be used for an initial demo/disconnected operation. There is a natural migration path to richer services such as Azure Spatial Anchors The implementation is extracted and refined from SpectatorView . Naturally, SpectatorView will be the first consumer of the new API. WebRTC Signalling Goal: Provide an integrated WebRTC signalling service. Remove the need for an external solution. WebRTC provides a lot of value. But the need to implement signalling can be an obstacle. With this milestone, a developer can easily get multiple devices connected, without the requirement to run a server. Matchmaking Transport Goal: Make Matchmaking work without requiring devices to be on the same subnet. Provide a service and client libraries to allow discovery based on something other than the (somewhat arbitrary) network connection."
