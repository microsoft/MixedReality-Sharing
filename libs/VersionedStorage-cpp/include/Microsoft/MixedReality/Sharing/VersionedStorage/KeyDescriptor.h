// interact with other KeyHandle objects without actually creating a KeyHandle
// (when doing so would be expensive).

// For example, if the application uses interned strings as keys, and wants to
// look for a string_view, it can implement KeyDescriptor that will work with
// string_view directly, without creating an interned string first,
// assuming that all operations are consistent with the actual KeyHandle.
//
// Most KeyDescriptor objects should be created on the stack and discarded after
// use if used with mutating operations, such as inserting a new subkey, because
// these operations are allowed to call non-const methods, which are allowed to
// mutate KeyDescriptor, rendering it unusable for any further calls.

  // to add a reference to existing_handle).
