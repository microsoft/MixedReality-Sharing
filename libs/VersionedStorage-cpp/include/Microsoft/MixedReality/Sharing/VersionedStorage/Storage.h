// A versioned snapshottable map-like data structure.
// It supports two-level addressing, with keys and subkeys within a key, where
// keys are abstract handles (see enums.h for details), and subkeys are
// uint64_t.
// Payloads associated with subkeys are abstract handles as well.
// The state of the storage changes atomically by applying transactions.
// To observe the state, a snapshot of the state must be taken (which is a
// relatively cheap operation). The state of the snapshot is then going to be
// immutable for the duration of its lifetime, even if new transactions were
// applied to the storage

  // snapshots does not prevent new transactions from being applied (in which
  // case calling GetSnapshot() will return a newer snapshot without affecting
  // the old ones). Any amount of snapshots can be alive at the same time (up to
  // the memory limit).
  // The snapshot itself is a thin object that just marks a certain versions in
  // the in-memory blobs as "in use," which ensures that the latest state with
  // the version less or equal to the "in use" one stays visible to readers.
  // For example, if a subkey had payload A on version 10, B on version 20, and
  // C on version 30, and the snapshot for version 25 is alive, the state B will
  // stay discoverable (because for this snapshot this is the actual state of
  // this subkey).
