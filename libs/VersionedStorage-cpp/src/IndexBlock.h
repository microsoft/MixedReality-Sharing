// Indexes up to 7 keys/subkeys.
//
// Each slot can be occupied by a pair of state block and version block
// locations. For each slot the index also stores its type (implicitly, encoded
// as the number of used key and subkey slots) and a small 8-bit hash associated
// with it. Using these hashes, the readers can quickly check which slots are
// likely to point to the state block they are looking for, and only then go to
// the block and verify that the key (and possibly the subkey) match.
//
// Since the location of the version block is stored in the index (and not, for
// example, in the state block), the reader can start prefetching the version
// block before the state block is obtained and checked. This reduces the
// overall time spent on waiting for the memory when performing a random search.
//
// Since there could be multiple observers of various versions of the state (and
// some of the observers can work with elements deleted in new versions), the
// index doesn't support deletion. New elements are inserted into index until it
// runs out of capacity (or the blob runs out of capacity for data blocks). Then
// the new blob is allocated, and keys and subkeys that are still alive are
// copied there. Then the old blob gets deallocated when none of its versions
// are referenced. This strategy ensures that old keys and subkeys are
// eventually getting deleted, and the index, on average, doesn't contain too
// many irrelevant entries.
