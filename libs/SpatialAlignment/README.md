# Spatial Alignment

This component contains engine agnostic C# code as well as a Unity component.

## Build Instructions

The setup will be greatly updated in the future, but for now, to have the Unity component build follow these steps:

1. Open the root Microsoft.MixedReality.Sharing.sln Visual Studio Solution.
2. Build the Solution, which will copy the files into the Unity projects.
3. If there are errors with the copy, delete contents of `unity/Assets/SpatialAlignment.Common.Output` folder.
